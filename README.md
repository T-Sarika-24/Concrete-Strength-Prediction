# Concrete-Strength-Prediction
The dataset used in this project can be found here . It contains the following features:
Cement
Blast Furnace Slag
Fly Ash
Water
Superplasticizer
Coarse Aggregate
Fine Aggregate
Age
Concrete Compressive Strength (target variable)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers.
Visualized relationships between features and the target variable using plots.

Modeling
Two regression models were implemented:
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Both models were trained on the training dataset, and predictions were made on the test dataset.

Model Performance
The models achieved the following performance metrics:
Random Forest R² Score
XGBoost R² Score

Results
The regression models demonstrated good predictive performance, with R² scores indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual concrete strength values.
